  ### This output generates a table using the uploaded ".csv" file. It
  ### first generates the object 'data' from the 'input''data_file'. The
  ### extension is then obtained using the tools::file_ext command, to 
  ### confirm the file extension is indeed ".csv". The following arguments
  ### will then require 2 things to be true.
  ### 1. The 'data' object is required, req(), to be present. This prevents
  ###    generation of an empty data plot.
  ### 2. The 'ext' object must be validated, validate(), as "csv". This 
  ###    confirms that the uploaded data must be in a '.csv' format. If it 
  ###    is not, an error message will be sent asking the user to confirm 
  ###    the file format being uploaded.
  ### Assuming these are met, 'output$csv.data' object will be stored as a 
  ### dataframe from the 'read.csv' command enacted on the uploaded file. 
  ### It will also designate the "header" as the previously mentioned
  ### 'input$header' value, ensuring these two are equivalent.
  
  output$csv.data <- renderTable({
    data <- input$data_file
    ext <- tools::file_ext(data$datapath)
    
    req(data)
    validate(need(ext == "csv", "Please confirm uploaded file extension is saved
                  in a '.csv' format."))
    read.csv(data$datapath, header = input$header)
  })
  
  ### Plot progress so far. The file is successfully connected to file upload.
  ### The 'data' and 'ext' features can likely be streamlined in the future,
  ### as they are repetitive, and will be used if we integrate stats as well, 
  ### or any other tool. req() and validate() as well. 
  
  ### The first two steps are straight forward, saving the data as an object.
  ### This, again, can probably be streamlined later. It stores the uploaded
  ### file as 'data_1'. It then pivots the data to a long format, taking all
  ### input columns and shifting them into three columns (Check my hw_09 
  ### print(long_colony_counts), the output would be the same). The commands 
  ### will probably need adjusting, but essentially here are the requirements.
  ### 1. The first data column with data to be compared MUST be named 'Sample'.
  ###    There are a couple of issues here. '.csv' files can be saved several
  ###    ways. If you save it as the default, comma delimited file type, this
  ###    will not work. This is due to the first column being named
  ###    differently than it appears in a program like excel. Instead of 
  ###    saving as 'Sample' it will save as 'Ã¯..Sample'. I tried adjusting the
  ###    code to account for this but got some errors.
